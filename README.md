# What is this? 

This is a very simple webserver that runs on a ESP32 that takes a reading from a door sensor and provides a binary open/close metric. 
As checked in this repo it's at http://ip-of-your-esp32:9000





Credit to ESP32.io whom I learned how to read the door sensor from:

Credit to codetiger as I learned how to write a simple web exporter from them:
